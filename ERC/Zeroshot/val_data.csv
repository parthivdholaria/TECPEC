793,3,Monica,With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time !,
793,4,Monica,And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here ! !,
793,5,Monica,"Okay , whatever , I really have not thought about it that much .",
793,6,Chandler,"Well , I like that idea .",
793,7,Chandler,Obviously !,
793,8,Chandler,"I was thinking maybe ... maybe ... maybe it could be a game room , you know ?",
793,9,Chandler,"I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh , like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $ 200 , the real ones ! The big ... big ones !",
793,10,Monica,No .,

793,13,Chandler,"So , that is it ?",
793,14,Monica,I just do not think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room . The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques .,
793,15,Chandler,Which is why Asteroids is perfect ! It’s the oldest game !,
793,16,Monica,What do you have against the beautiful guest room ?,
793,17,Chandler,"I do not have anything against the beautiful guest room , especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away !",
793,18,Monica,Are you mocking me ?,
793,19,Chandler,"No , I am not mocking you , or you beautiful guest room .",
799,1,Ross,"Hey ! Oh listen , I was just clearing some space for your stuff .",
799,2,Rachel,"Oh thanks , but listen , I was just at Monica and she and Chandler had a big fight and they are not moving in .",
799,3,Ross,"What do you mean , they are not moving in ? They ... they are still moving in right ?",
799,4,Rachel,"No ... no , they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room .",
799,5,Ross,What ? ! Over a stupid room !,
799,6,Rachel,"Yeah , I feel kinda bad for them , but I am also really psyched cause I do not have to move in here !",
799,7,Ross,"Oh no , yeah no , that part great !",
800,1,Ross,"What all this about you guys fighting ? ! Is this really over a room ? ! I mean , that is so silly !",
800,2,Monica,"Ross , we can handle this .",
800,3,Ross,"Well , apparently not , and I can not just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly .",
800,4,Ross,"I mean , enough of the silliness !",
800,5,Chandler,"Well , why do not you tell her to stop being silly !",
800,6,Ross,Okay ... okay !,
800,7,Ross,"Two very good points , look I have known you both a long time , and I have never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you have been since you have got together .",
800,8,Ross,Do you really want to throw that all away over a room ?,
800,9,Ross,That is so silly .,
800,10,Ross,"Now wh ... what is more important , love or silliness ?",
800,11,Chandler,"Well , we are fond of the silliness , but we also have a soft spot for the love .",
800,12,Monica,Love is the best medicine .,
800,13,Chandler,That is laughter .,
800,14,Monica,Why do you do it ?,
800,15,Chandler,I do not know .,
800,16,Ross,"Okay ! All right ! Now , Chandler you ... you wanna live with Monica , right ?",
800,17,Chandler,"Yeah , I do .",
800,18,Ross,"And Mon , you wanna live with Chandler , do not you ?",
800,19,Monica,Yes .,
800,20,Ross,Good ! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York !,
801,1,Rachel,"All right , well the place was closed . I will just copy it later .",
801,2,Joey,"Or not . Uh , Rach , why do not you just move in with me ?",
801,3,Ross,"Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa , Joey !",
801,4,Joey,"No ... no ... no ... no ... no ... no ... no ... no ... It is okay , I mean I ... look Rach , I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday thing , but we do not have to do that !",
801,5,Rachel,"Well , it would be easier to move just right across the hall . Wait a minute , unless you are thinking about Naked Wednesday .",
801,6,Joey,"Thursday clearly not good for you , pick a day !",
807,1,Joey,"But um , I do not think it is anything serious .",
807,2,Chandler,This sounds like a hernia . You have to ... you ... you ... Go to the doctor !,
807,3,Joey,No way !,
807,4,Joey,"Kay look , if I have to go to the doctor for anything , it is gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach !",
807,5,Joey,Why did I have to start working out again ?,
807,6,Joey,Damn you 15s !,

809,3,Monica,You stole them from me !,
809,4,Rachel,You stole them from me ! !,
809,5,Monica,Gimme them !,
809,6,Monica,You just wanna each take one ?,
809,7,Rachel,Yeah that seems fair . We never use them .,
809,8,Ross,"Look , I really need some help , okay ? Why ? Why did I have to speak in a British accent ? ! What do I do ?",
809,9,Rachel,Well,
809,10,Monica,Why do not you phase it out ?,
809,11,Monica,"Yeah , fade the accent out and people will think you are , you know , that you are adjusting to life in America .",
809,12,Rachel,"Yeah , I mean , come on Ross , no one will even notice . I mean they are probably not even listening to you !",
809,13,Ross,They are not listening to me ?,
809,14,Rachel,Of course they are listening to you ! Everybody listens to you .,
809,15,Ross,"Monica , you really think I should try this phasing out thing ?",
809,16,Monica,I think you look fine .,

816,8,Phoebe,"Na ... uh , no , we are all responsible for our own babies .",
816,9,Chandler,See that is where I think that you are wrong . We have been playing these babies man for man . we should really be playing a zone defense .,

817,1,Judge,Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment ?,
817,2,Rachel,"Yes your honor , and here are , are forms , all filled out .",
