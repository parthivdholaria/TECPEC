1806,1,Monica,How long before it starts getting annoying ?,

1810,13,Chandler,Did you correct him ?,
1810,14,Ross,"No , I thought it would be more fun this way .",
1810,15,Monica,"This is so cool , maybe this is something you could do this every week .",
1810,16,Ross,Or you could sit on the porch ... and make sure no one steals the trashcans .,
1810,17,Ross,He does that every week too .,
1810,18,Monica,"Just so you know , you have to let him win . He hates to lose .",

1828,5,Chandler,You have to name all the states in six minutes .,
1828,6,Ross,"What ? That is , like , insanely easy .",
1828,7,Chandler,"No , it is harder than it sounds . You always forget at least one .",
1828,8,Chandler,"Or in some cases , 14 .",
1828,9,Monica,It is a stupid game and I was not playing against other people ...,
1828,10,Monica,"... so technically , I did not lose .",
1828,11,Ross,You forgot 14 states ?,
1828,12,Monica,Nobody cares about the Dakotas .,
1829,1,Monica,Ross apartment is nice ! How come we do not hang out here more often ?,
1829,2,Chandler,I do not know . Maybe because it smells weird .,
1829,3,Chandler,It is like old pumpkins or something .,
1829,4,Monica,That is my pie .,
1829,5,Chandler,Which smells delicious .,
1829,6,Monica,Uh,

1830,10,Chandler,If I am anywhere near a dog for more than five minutes ... my throat will just close up .,
1830,11,Phoebe,"That is odd , because this dog been living here for the past three days .",
1830,12,Chandler,Really ?,
1830,13,Monica,"If the dog has been here that long ... and you have not had a reaction , maybe you are not allergic to this dog .",

1832,6,Phoebe,He is not so smart .,
1832,7,Monica,Hey . I did not know either .,

1836,3,Monica,"Did you hear that , Chandler ?",
1836,4,Monica,No such thing .,
1836,5,Chandler,What happened ? I am just eating candy .,
1836,6,Rachel,Maybe it is not as bad as I think . Maybe they did not take it the way I meant it .,
1837,1,Chandler,"Absolutely , you know ? Because "" tushy "" can mean both ass and good worker .",
1837,2,Rachel,"Ugh , I just gotta get the thing back .",

1859,4,Cecilia,"she usually puts umm , both her hands on the man face .",
1859,5,Joey,"Yeah , I notice that . Is that because she is so passionate ?",
1859,6,Cecilia,"No , it is because that way the camera only sees her .",
1859,7,Cecilia,You want to try it ?,
1859,8,Joey,"Yeah , okay .",
1859,9,Cecilia,That was good . That was really good .,

1860,2,Ross,Were you the ones who called the cops ?,
1860,3,Chandler,That is not really important right now .,
1860,4,Chandler,"What is important is , while we appreciate the gesture , we just do not feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding .",
1860,5,Ross,Why not ?,
1860,6,Chandler,Because we hate them .,
1860,7,Ross,"Just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want . And I am not going to tell you what song I am gonna play either . But uh , let us just say when it is over I will bet there will be a wee bit celebration .",

1922,5,Monica,Do not you see ? It is the perfect crime .,
1922,6,Chandler,She must have been planning this for years .,
1922,7,Monica,I will prove it to you .,
1922,8,Monica,"About a week ago , I was wearing those jeans .",
1922,9,Monica,I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch .,
1922,10,Monica,"When she comes back , I will find it and show you that stain !",
1922,11,Chandler,Is it possible the company that sold the jeans ... made more than just the one pair ?,
1922,12,Monica,I guess .,

1924,14,Joey,"No room ? It is a baby . It is , like , this big .",

1925,4,Joey,I could use a challenge . It is getting pretty easy .,
1925,5,Rachel,"It is so sweet that you want me to stay , but I can not do that to you .",
1925,6,Rachel,"I mean , it would disrupt your entire life .",
1925,7,Joey,It is just ... I love living with you so much .,
1925,8,Joey,I wish things did not have to change .,
1925,9,Rachel,I know .,

1969,1,Chandler,What ? Why does she think that ?,
1969,2,Joey,Because it kind of looked like I did .,
1969,3,Chandler,"Again , what ?",
1969,4,Joey,"Okay , I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand ...",
1969,5,Chandler,As we all are at some point during the day .,
1969,6,Joey,It was not my ring . It fell out of Ross jacket . And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing !,
1969,7,Chandler,Ross had a ring ? And he was gonna propose ?,
1969,8,Joey,I guess .,
1969,9,Chandler,And you did it first ?,
1969,10,Chandler,This is gonna kill him . You know how much he loves to propose .,

1972,9,Ross,Why do not we talk about this on the way to the hospital ?,
1972,10,Joey,"Good , good . Yeah , maybe while we are there , they can check your reflexes .",
1972,11,Joey,Oops !,

1973,6,Joey,"Come on , you guys are more then that ! I mean , you are gonna get together right ?",
1973,7,Ross,I do not think that we are .,
1973,8,Joey,But you two are supposed to be together .,
1973,9,Ross,"Well , I thought so too . But then she said she would marry you .",
1973,10,Joey,"Come on , Ross , that did not mean anything ! She just had the baby , she was all freaked out about doing it alone , she would have said yes to anybody .",
1973,11,Ross,"Yeah , that is what she said .",
1973,12,Joey,So ?,
1973,13,Ross,So I do not want to be just anybody .,

1974,8,Monica,"No , you are just new at this .",
1974,9,Monica,You will get better .,
1974,10,Monica,"Think about your first day at work . I mean , that could not have been easy but you figured that out .",
1974,11,Rachel,"Yeah , I do not think dressing provocatively is going to help me here !",
1974,12,Rachel,"Oh , God , just please take her .",
1974,13,Monica,"Okay , I will take her . Come here .",
1975,1,Joey,Of course we do . He is playing a game we used to play in high school .,
1975,2,Joey,We pretend we do not know each other . We played all kinds of games .,
1975,3,Joey,You remember that one where I punch you in the face for not being cool ?,
1975,4,Phoebe,"Mike , let me ask you something : How many sisters does Joey have ?",
1975,5,Mike,Six .,
1975,6,Joey,What are you doing ? I said seven !,
1975,7,Joey,Aw !,
1975,8,Phoebe,"Joey , why did you set me up with a stranger ?",
1975,9,Joey,Because I forgot about our date . I am so sorry .,
1975,10,Mike,"I am sorry too . And just to be clear , I did not hit his mother with a car .",
1975,11,Phoebe,You are unbelievable . I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you .,
1975,12,Phoebe,Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose .,
1976,1,Ross,You promised not to say anything .,
1976,2,Rachel,I know .,
1976,3,Rachel,Ross still sees his pediatrician !,
1976,4,Rachel,I do not care .,
1976,5,Monica,Are you serious ? You still see Dr . Gettleman ?,
1976,6,Ross,He is a brilliant diagnostician !,
1976,7,Chandler,Diagnostician or boo ... boo fixer ?,
1976,8,Rachel,"Seriously , you gotta go to an appropriate doctor .",
1976,9,Ross,"Why ? I know it is a little weird , but , hey , he is a great doctor , okay ?",
1976,10,Ross,"He knows my medical history . And every time I go in there , he makes a big deal .",
1976,11,Ross,"You know , "" Ah , look , it is my favorite patient ! """,
1976,12,Chandler,Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your tushy ?,
1976,13,Ross,I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college .,
1976,14,Chandler,That was not a security blanket . That was a wall hanging .,
1976,15,Ross,It did not spend much time on the wall !,
1977,1,Phoebe,You kissed me .,
1977,2,Mike,Uh ... huh .,
1977,3,Phoebe,So you do not think I am a total freak ?,

1977,6,Phoebe,I guess so .,
1977,7,Phoebe,"Can I , can I think it is cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again ?",
1978,1,Chandler,"Well , do not believe everything you hear , Ken .",
1978,2,Chandler,"But yeah , that is true .",
1978,3,Chandler,"All right , let us get started by , uh , taking a look at last quarter figures .",
1978,4,Chandler,"Uh , Claudia , are not you supposed to blow smoke up the boss ass ?",
1978,5,Claudia,I am sorry . Does the smoke bother you ?,
1978,6,Chandler,"No , no , no , no . I smoked for years . Then I quit .",
1978,7,Chandler,"Right now , I can not remember why .",
1978,8,Chandler,"You are not allowed to smoke in this office though , right ?",
1978,9,Claudia,"Yes , in Oklahoma it is legal to smoke in offices with 15 people or less .",
1978,10,Claudia,Would you like one ?,
1978,11,Chandler,"All right , look . I do not smoke anymore . But if the rest of you want to light up , go ahead , it is fine .",
1978,12,Chandler,"So you all smoke , then ? Heh .",
1978,13,Chandler,"You know , it is almost rude that I am not smoking .",
1978,14,Ken,That is not true . If you do not wanna smoke ...,
1978,15,Chandler,"Ken , please !",
1978,16,Chandler,"No , I can not . I can not smoke . If I smoke , my wife would kill me .",
1978,17,Ken,"I am sorry , but is not your wife back in New York ?",
1978,18,Chandler,"I have always liked you , Ken .",
1979,1,Mike,It is to my apartment .,
1979,2,Phoebe,"Oh wow , ooh ! Ooh , big step for Phoebe and Mike .",
1979,3,Mike,"Yeah , look , and I do not want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because ...",
1979,4,Phoebe,"No , I want to .",
1979,5,Mike,"Oh , thank God .",
1979,6,Phoebe,Yeah .,
1979,7,Phoebe,"Wow . I was starting to think I would never meet someone that , you know , I wanted to do this with .",
1979,8,Phoebe,Here you go .,
1979,9,Mike,"This is cool , huh ?",
1979,10,Phoebe,It really is .,
1979,11,Joey,"Oh , I know it . It is amazing . These little things open doors .",
1980,1,Joey,"Yeah , I can see it .",
1980,2,Chandler,"Look at these videos . I mean , who does he think he is ?",
1980,3,Chandler,"Magnum Force , Dirty Harry , Cool Hand Luke .",
1980,4,Chandler,"Oh , my God .",

1980,6,Chandler,There is a tape here with Monica name on it .,
1980,7,Joey,Ooh . A tape with a girl name on it . It is probably a sex tape .,
1980,8,Joey,"Wait a minute . This says "" Monica "" .",
1980,9,Joey,And this is Richard apartment ...,
1980,10,Chandler,Get there faster !,
1981,1,Phoebe,"Okay , yeah , your mom . She looks nice . I can talk to her .",

1981,3,Phoebe,"Oh Bitsy , hi . Uhm ... listen I just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight .",
1981,4,Bitsy,"Well , not at all .",
1981,5,Phoebe,"Also , um , I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is .",
1981,6,Bitsy,Thank you . I think so too .,
1981,7,Phoebe,"Well , and you know , it really is a testament to how he was raised . Especially to you . Because he is very respectful of women .",
1981,8,Bitsy,Is he really ?,
1981,9,Phoebe,Are you kidding ? He is so considerate of my feelings and ... you know I think ... you would also like to know that he is a very gentle lover .,
1981,10,Bitsy,Excuse me ?,
1981,11,Phoebe,"Oh no , no , no . Do not get me wrong . No , he is not in like a sissy way .",
1981,12,Phoebe,"No , no , no ... when he gets going , he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave ...",
1981,13,Bitsy,That is ... my boy .,
1981,14,Mike,Awesome .,
1982,1,Chandler,"Well , what is wrong with me ? Am I incompetent ? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you !",
1982,2,Rachel,"You are taking this the wrong way . We think you will be a wonderful parent . It is just ... You are more the , you know , fun parent .",
1982,3,Ross,"Yeah ! And we wanna make sure that Emma also has someone like Monica , who is more of a disciplinarian ... someone who can be firm , and strict .",
1982,4,Monica,"That is not how you see me , is it ?",
1982,5,Phoebe,"No , you are all about the fun .",
1982,6,Chandler,"I may not know a lot about babies , but do you really think I am not capable ?",
1982,7,Ross,No . You both are equally capable . It is just you are strongest when you are together .,
1982,8,Chandler,"Okay . So if we both had Emma , and I died ...",
1982,9,Chandler,... she would have to give her up .,
1982,10,Ross,Sure . Monica would have to give her up .,
1982,11,Joey,"I lie better than that , right ?",
1982,12,Chandler,"So ... so let me get this straight . So my two friends die , I get Emma , then my wife dies , then Emma the one ... tiny ... ray ... of ... hope left in my life , gets taken away from me ?",
1982,13,Phoebe,There is your movie !,
1983,1,Rachel,"Oh , well , it is complicated . I do not actually have a boyfriend , but , uh ...",
1983,2,BILL,Then can I have your number ?,
1983,3,Rachel,"I am sorry , no .",
1983,4,BILL,Okay .,
1983,5,Rachel,"Oh , sure .",
1984,1,Phoebe,"Yeah , I see what you mean .",
1984,2,Phoebe,"By the way , nice Ross imitation .",
1984,3,Phoebe,But your Rachel was not whiny enough .,
1984,4,Rachel,What ? Hey .,
1984,5,Phoebe,Better .,
1984,6,Rachel,The point is maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross . You know ? I should just move on with my life .,
1984,7,Phoebe,"So really , you are moving on from Ross ?",
1984,8,Rachel,I do not know . Do I have to decide right now ?,
1984,9,Phoebe,You kind of just did . That guy is gonna call you tonight .,
1984,10,Phoebe,"Ross is gonna pick up the phone , and that is a pretty clear message .",
1984,11,Rachel,"Oh , my God , Ross .",
1984,12,Rachel,Ross is gonna pick up the phone .,
1984,13,Rachel,"Oh , I have to get my number back . Oh , my God , he is gone .",

1985,11,Phoebe,"Well , you have to go back in .",
1985,12,Mike,What ? Go back ?,
1985,13,Mike,To the land where time stands still ?,
1985,14,Phoebe,"I am so sorry , honey , but ...",
1985,15,Phoebe,"Okay , Rachel gave this guy her number , and , erm , she does not want Ross to answer the phone , so you have to intercept all of his calls .",
1985,16,Mike,I can not do that !,
1985,17,Phoebe,He says he can not do that .,
1985,18,Rachel,"Oh , give me the phone .",
1985,19,Rachel,"Hi , Mike . Hi , listen , I know that this is a lot to ask , but you know what ? If you do this , Phoebe will do anything you want .",

1985,22,Phoebe,"Hello ? Hi , I am sorry about her . But actually , she was not wrong about the dirty stuff .",
1985,23,Mike,"All right , I will do it .",
1985,24,Mike,"But really , how much dirtier can it get ?",
1985,25,Phoebe,"Oh , Mike .",
1986,1,Chandler,What is he doing ?,
1986,2,Monica,I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy .,
1986,3,Joey,Bedroom clear . Although you might need some new pillows .,
1986,4,Chandler,"All right , well , I will check the guest room .",
1987,1,Chandler,The wife says hi .,
1987,2,Wendy,Ah . Fun conversation ?,
1987,3,Chandler,"Ah well , she is got this weird idea , that , uh , you know , just because you and I are alone , that something is gonna happen .",
1987,4,Wendy,Huh ? Really ?,
1987,5,Wendy,Hmm . Would that be so terrible ?,
1987,6,Chandler,"This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about , but ... you are getting ham on my only tie .",
1987,7,Chandler,"Whoa , back off , missy .",
1987,8,Wendy,"Ha , ha . Missy ?",
1987,9,Chandler,I do not know . I am not used to girls making passes at me .,

1987,19,Chandler,"Well , look , it is not easy to spend this much time apart .",
1987,20,Chandler,She is entitled to be a little paranoid .,
1987,21,Chandler,"Or , in this case , right on the money .",
1988,1,Monica,"Okay , I have looked through a bunch of career guides , photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision .",
1988,2,Chandler,How long was I in there ?,
1988,3,Monica,"Okay , let us start with the A . Advertising .",
1988,4,Chandler,"Wait . Advertising , that is a great idea .",
1988,5,Monica,"Well , do not you wanna look through the rest ?",

1995,5,Phoebe,"So , what are we gonna do ? Are we just gonna set them up with people ?",
1995,6,Joey,"I know , that just pushes them further and further apart .",

2001,7,Phoebe,"Uh ... huh , uh ... huh .",
2001,8,Phoebe,And why do you think that is ?,
2001,9,Rachel,I do not know . Maybe it is because she is got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar .,
2001,10,Phoebe,Or ... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you are such a high maintenance tight ass !,
2001,11,Rachel,Phoebe ! !,
2001,12,Phoebe,You know it is me ?,
2002,1,Ross,"And sure he does not know that much about art but you know , you can always talk about that with someone else .",
2002,2,Charlie,"Yeah , I guess that is true .",
2002,3,Ross,"And if you think about it , I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you .",
